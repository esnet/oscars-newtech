Feature: design deserialization

  I want to verify that i can serialize and persist designs

  Scenario: Basic loading
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/simple.json"
    When I clear the "design" repository
    Then I can persist the design
    When I load the design from the repository
    Then the "design" repository has 1 entries
    Then the "schedule" repository has 0 entries
    Then the "fixture" repository has 2 entries
    Then the "junction" repository has 2 entries
    Then the "pipe" repository has 1 entries
    Then the "vlan" repository has 2 entries

    Then I did not receive an exception


  Scenario: Invalid design - missing required property
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given The world is expecting an exception
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/invalid-missing-property.json"
    Then I did receive an exception

  Scenario: Invalid design - null required property
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given The world is expecting an exception
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/invalid-null-property.json"
    Then I did receive an exception

  Scenario: Invalid design - unknown property
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given The world is expecting an exception
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/invalid-unknown-property.json"
    Then I did receive an exception

  Scenario: Invalid design - missing ref
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given The world is expecting an exception
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/invalid-missing-ref.json"
    Then I did receive an exception

  Scenario: Invalid design - bad ref
    Given I have initialized the world
    Given The world is expecting an exception
    Given I load a design from "config/test/designs/invalid-bad-ref.json"
    Then I did receive an exception
